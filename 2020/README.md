# Advent of Code 2020

I'm trying to do this with many different programming languages. A rule I'll set is
that I can't use the same language two days in a row.

## Usage

Start new day:
```bash
# get session id from cookies of website after logging in
cd bin
AOC_DIR=/location/of/aoc/root ./start_day.rb <year> <day_number> <session_id>
```

- [x] day 1 (golang)
- [x] day 2 (typescript)
- [x] day 3 (ruby)
- [x] day 4 (rust)
- [x] day 5 (python)
- [x] day 6 (C)
- [x] day 7 (python)
- [x] day 8 (python) !Cheated!
- [] day ? (R)
